You can download this document from the <a href=http://www.freedb.org/sections.php?op=viewarticle&artid=27>Download/Misc-section</a> for offline-reading.
<h3>Introduction</h3>
Since we noticed, that freedb support in many programs is not as good as it could be, we thought it might be a good idea to create something like a checklist you can use, when adding freedb support to your program. Please read this document carefully when adding freedb support to a program, as it tries to help you to do things as good as possible.
<p>
If you add freedb support to a program or change parts of your program concerning freedb support, we would be glad, if you would provide us with a testing-version of your program before releasing it, so we can test it ourselves and notify you, if something doesn't work as it should (applies only to programs running on Windows, Linux/Unix and BeOS as we cannot test programs running on other systems ourselves).<br>
If you inform us about a new release adding freedb support to your application or including major improvements in freedb support, we're also willing to put a note about that on our web site. Additionally the program can be added to our list of freedb aware programs.
<p>
<h3>General:</h3>
<ul>
<li>Please support submit to freedb, to give users chance to support freedb by submitting information for unknown discs. This is very important for the freedb concept to work, since freedb is completely dependent on users submitting information about new CD's.</li>
<li>Please consider supporting the offline database in Windows- and Unix-format (you can find more information on the Windows- and Unix-format in freedb-howto). Many users download the database archives to avoid having to go online for each freedb query.</li>
<li>Make absolutely sure that the disc ID is generated correctly. For CD Extra CD's you have to include the data-track for the disc ID and track offsets! This can be somewhat tricky, since you cannot use the MCI-interface to get the TOC - it will not report the data-track! For Windows you will have to use ASPI (or native NT calls in NT/2000) as a workaround. To check if your program is generating the disc ID correctly, please compare the results of your program with the disc ID xmcd generates for as large a number of CDs as possible if you have access to a Linux system. For Windows you can also use the Disc ID calculator, which you can find in our download/misc section.</li>
<li>Provide support for http-proxies - users behind restrictive firewalls might need to use a proxy.</li>
<li>Please consider supporting batch queries/submits, so that the user doesn't have to be online for each CD he wants to query or submit.</li>
<li>When naming freedb, name it freedb or freedb.org - not freecddb, FreeDB or anything else.</li>
<li>If connecting to the freedb-server fails or no matching entry was found, present the user an appropriate error-message (this applies of course to query and submit).</li>
<li>Please consider also supporting the EXT-fields of the database entries to give users a chance to see and add additional info on the CD or specific tracks to the database entry (see the database format specification for more info on the EXT-fields).</li>
</ul>

<h3>Config:</h3>
<ul>
<li>Give the user the possibility to specify a server manually (so he can use a local server).</li>
<li>Provide the user with an option to get the sites-list from the actually selected server (if that doesn't work, try getting it from freedb.freedb.org)</li>
<li>When presenting the sites-list to the user, also show the location-information received when using the sites-command</li>
<li>Make the cgi-path for http-access user-configurable. Although we do not intend to change the default path, users running the freedb server software on a local server may be using use a different path.
<li>Make the submit-email-address for email-submission user-configurable. The possibility to change the email-submission-address can be used to make test submissions to the test-submit-address (which might be useful to analyze possible problems) or to allow submit to a private local  server</li>
<li>If you support cddbp, let the user specify the port for cddbp-access. Port 8880 should be default, since it causes less problems with firewalls than the "old" port 888 (which is still supported by our servers).</li>
<li>When using the email-submit-method, allow specifying a mail server to be used for sending the email to.</li>
<li>Let the user specify an email-address, which you use for requests and submits. You may use a predefined (fake-)email-address for requests, if you are concerned about privacy (although we assure, that we do not use the email-addresses provided for freedb access for anything), while you may never submit to freedb, if the user hasn't specified an email-address himself, as we must be able to send a possible rejection-notice to the user.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Access:</h3>
<ul>
<li>Every application should use the http-method to access freedb, since cddbp access often causes problems with firewalls preventing the communication via port 888 or 8880. You may additionally offer the possibility to use cddbp instead, however.</li>
<li>Always use the highest supported protocol level (currently level 5).</li>
<li>Make sure, that inexact matches (return-code 211) and multiple exact matches (return-code 210) are supported and present the list of possible matches to the user, to select the correct entry.</li>
<li>Always do a query before reading from the database.</li>
<li>Always specify the programs own name and full version, when accessing the server.</li>
<li>When using http-access, please make sure, that you don't use something like<br>
POST http://selected_server/~cddb/cddb.cgi HTTP/1.0<br>
Instead use<br>
POST /~cddb/cddb.cgi HTTP/1.0<br>
(same applies to GET)<br>
Although both methods work with the official servers, only the later complies to the RFC's, since the former may only be used when the request is being made to a proxy (see RFC1945). The former command-syntax can cause problems on private freedb servers.</li>
<li>Make sure that you support information split to two or more lines (for more info on this take a look at the database format specification).</li>
</ul>
<h3>Submit:</h3>
<ul>
<li>Make sure submissions are submitted in 7bit US-ASCII or in the ISO-8859-1 character set. Other character sets are not supported.</li>
<li>When submitting by email and using the ISO-8859-1 character set, you should use the MIME "quoted-printable" scheme to encode the message to avoid the risk, that the 8th bit is stripped off during email submit.</li>
<li>Please consider using the X-Cddbd-Note:-header in the submit-email or for http-submit.  For more information on the X-Cddbd-Note:-header, please check the freedb-howto.</li>
<li>Check, that none of the fields are empty and no field contains the default-string (this also applies to the genre: please set no default for the genre for an unknown disc, but let the user choose the genre).</li>
<li>Always specify the name and the full version of your program in the submitted entry - if it's an alpha or beta, also state that (check database format specification for more info how the format for this is).</li>
<li>When submitting a new entry to the freedb, the revision specified in the submitted entry should be 0.</li>
<li>When submitting an entry received from freedb and modified by a user, increment the revision number by one (since entries having the same or a lower revision than an existing entry will be discarded).</li>
<li>When submitting an entry received from freedb and modified by a user, the genre of the entry should be pre-selected and not editable for submit, since resubmitting an entry to another genre will not overwrite the old entry, but additionally create a new entry in the new genre. This is only necessary for the general genre, not the specific genre specified in the DGENRE field of an entry, which may of course be updated.</li>
<li>Make sure, that lines in the submission are no longer than 256 chars. If the line is longer, you have to split the information to two or more lines (you can find more information on this in the database format specification).</li>
<li>When submitting information from a local entry or resubmitting an entry received from freedb after the user has made changes to it, make sure that you correct the track-offset and disc ID information for the inserted CD.</li>
